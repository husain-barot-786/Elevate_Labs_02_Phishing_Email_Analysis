----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task Title    : Phishing Email Analysis
Tools Used    : Email header, Mousepad, Browser
Platform Used : Kali Linux (Terminal)

------------------
1. Sender Analysis
------------------

From: Williams Sankoh <Williams_Sankoh@info.org>

Reply-To: <williams.sankoh@yandex.com>

Red Flag: Mismatch between sender domain (info.org) and reply-to domain (yandex.com) – often used to redirect replies away from legitimate servers.

----------------------------------
2. Header Analysis (via MXToolbox)
----------------------------------

Check                | Result
---------------------|-------------------------
DMARC                | No DMARC record found
SPF Authentication   | SPF passed
SPF Alignment        | Failed
DKIM Authentication  | Failed
DKIM Alignment       | Failed
ARC Authentication   | Passed

Red Flags:
- DMARC missing – Cannot validate domain authenticity.
- SPF and DKIM alignment failed – Email may be spoofed.
- DKIM failed – Message may be altered or unsigned.

----------------------
3. Email Body Analysis
----------------------

Tone: Polite but suspicious.
Language: No grammar/spelling errors.
Urgency: Indirect. Suggests immediate investment.
Type of Attack: Business Proposal Scam / Social Engineering

Red Flags:
- Generic greeting: “Dear Sir / Madam”
- Outlandish business claim: $6.8 million investment
- Requests personal contact information
- Asks to meet in person for financial dealings
- Uses vague sender identity and unverifiable background

-----------------------
4. Links or Attachments
-----------------------

Links: None found
Attachments: None

Note: Absence of links does not eliminate phishing risk.

----------------
5. Final Verdict
----------------

This email displays multiple phishing indicators:

- Sender and reply-to mismatch

- Social engineering techniques
- Request for confidential contact and financial discussion

Classification: Phishing Email (Business Scam)

---------
Learnings
---------

This case demonstrates the importance of:
- Email header analysis
- Authentication mechanisms like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
- Identifying social engineering content

Best practice: Never trust emails that request money, investment, or personal info, come from mismatched or non-corporate domains, or seem too good to be true.
